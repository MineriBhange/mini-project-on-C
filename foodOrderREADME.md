#About the Project

The Simple Online Food Ordering System has the admin side and visitor/client-side. The admin will manage all the data needed for the website more importantly the list of available menus. The client will browse the website, explore and choose his/her desired menu's and save it to cart for later checkout. After that, the client will go to the cart, review his/ her order, confirm the delivery address and other information, and place his/ her order. This is an easy to use project, if you're planning to build or develop an ordering system for a restaurant or cafe,  this project will be a good start.
